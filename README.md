# CakePHP NotificationUI Plugin

The **NotificationUI** plugin provides UI components for the CakePHP Notification system with real-time broadcasting support. It includes a modern notification bell widget with dropdown or side panel display modes, automatic polling for new notifications, and a complete JavaScript API for managing notifications.

The plugin features a modular JavaScript architecture with template overloading support, allowing complete customization of notification rendering. It integrates seamlessly with the Broadcasting plugin for real-time WebSocket delivery while maintaining database persistence for reliable notification storage.

The plugin provides RESTful JSON API endpoints for notification management, event-driven architecture for reacting to notification events, and comprehensive support for both database-persisted and ephemeral broadcasting-only notifications.
